# Photino.NET + React Demo

This is a demo of how to use Photino.NET with Vite React for UI based on the [photinoreact](
https://docs.tryphotino.io/Quick-Start-for-.NET-Developers) template.
Every project has it's own README.md file to get you started.

You will be able to read more about it soon on my blog [hasselmann.click](hasselmann.click).

## Frontend
- This is the React SPA, which serves as the UI.

## Photino
- This is the desktop app, which uses the SPA as frontend on windows and linux (and also macOS, but I didn't try that for lack of resources)

## Web
- This is the web server, which serves the SPA as static files
